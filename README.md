# What is this?

Basically a C++/Qt implementation of the classic TicTaeToe. It has no shiny features but works well for understanding some of the fundamentals behind Qt UIs. 

# How to use it

## Step 1

Get your software. Download and install [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download) (used for this project) or get the C++/Qt setup that suits you the best.

## Step 2

`git clone` this repository, open the `TicTacToe.pro` file in your setup and build it. That's it. There are no other dependencies beyond Qt.
